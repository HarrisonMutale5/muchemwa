                Aneamia is a heamatological disorder that is characterised by reduced Haemoglobin (Hb)
                levels in the blood&#46; 
                Aneamia is defined as a redaction in red blood cells 
                Hb is a molecule that is attached to a red blood cell. Hb molecule consists of two tetramer proteins
                called heme and globin. the main function of Hb is to carry oxgyen to all parts of the body, so 
                Aneamia develops if there is diminished Hb levels that can be due to :-

                <br>
                1&#41; RBC's destraction eg. due to increased uric acid in renal problems such as kidney failure &#46; <br> 
                2&#41; RBC's loss eg. via bleeding &#46; <br>
                3&#41; RBC's less production eg. cancer of the bone marrow&#46;

                  <h3> Investigations</h3>
                  1&#41; full blood count <br>
                  2&#41; haematocrit exemination <br> 
                  3&#41; Hb (this depends on sex of the patient) <br> 
                  4&#41; bone marrow exemination <br>
                  5&#41; schilling test (this is used to determine how well can a patient Absorb 
                  vitamine B12 from thier intestinal tract) 
                  <h3>Treatment</h3> 
                  Treatment of Aneamia depends on the cause and type, the sevelity and physical 
                  appearance of the patient on examintion. lab results such as FBC plays a major 
                  role in the treatment of Aneamia, knowing the Hb of the patient is an important factor 
                  to follow or not when treating an Aneamic patient
                  The Hb of the patient will arlet the Doctor or Clinician on which type of treatment method 
                  to commence on the patient. <br> 
                  &#x02010; there are different type of approaches and Medications in the treatment of Aneamia, 
                  the Medications come in different formulars and presentions. <br> 
                  <br> 
                  These are :- <br>
                  &#x02010; oral pills (tablets,) <br>
                  &#x02010; injectables <br>
                  &#x02010; Syrups <br>
                  &#x02010; blood transfusion 
                  <h5>Oral Pills </h5>
                  common ones <br>
                  &#x02010; folic acid <br>
                  &#x02010; ferrous sulphate
                  <h5>Injectables</h5>
                  commonly used <br>
                  &#x02010; iron sucrose (this is usally given in severe cases of Aneamia in normal saline)  
                  <h5>Syrups (iron supplements)</h5>
                  &#x02010; hem-up <br>
                  &#x02010; ranferon <br>
                  &#x02010; hemoforce <br>
                  &#x02010; R.B Tone <br>
                  &#x02010; feroglobin etc. 
                  <h5> Blood transfusion</h5> 
                  one pint of blood increases Hb levels by 1g&#x0002F;dl <br>
                  &#x02010; patient may also present with other signs and Symptoms, so you need to add up some Medications to help 
                  treat them, for example&#x0003A;&#x02010; <br>
                  &#x02022; pain (give pain killers) <br> 
                  &#x02022; cover the patient on antibiotics from bacterial infections <br>
                  &#x02022; rehydrate the patient (this depends on histroy and physical examintion)
                  etc.
